# SolidWorks Drawing Exporter UI

A user-friendly Python GUI built with `tkinter` that allows you to batch export SolidWorks drawings (`.SLDDRW`) to both PDF and DWG formats. It also supports exporting part/assembly files to STEP format, making it an efficient tool for engineers and technical teams working with multiple SolidWorks outputs.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Export multiple `.SLDDRW` drawings to:
  - PDF (single file or individual sheets)
  - DWG (single file or individual sheets)
- Export parts or assemblies (`.SLDPRT`/`.SLDASM`) to STEP format
- Select and manage files through an intuitive interface
- Save and load project settings to JSON
- Visual progress bar and status updates
- Built-in error messages and user confirmations

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- SolidWorks installed on the same machine
- Python packages:
  - `pywin32`
  - `tkinter` (usually comes with Python)
  
To install `pywin32`:
```bash
pip install pywin32
